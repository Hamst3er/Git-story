----------------------------------------------------------------------- PROMPT -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From birth, your parents have done everything they could to stop you from going out during a full moon. 
At the age of 18, curiosity overwhelms you and you sneak out of the house during a full moon. You take a peek at the moon, and suddenly you turn into a log cabin. You are a werehouse.

  My phone buzzed to life and let out a screech.
  I was seventeen years old at the time. The date was Tuesday, November thirtieth, 1926, and I was enjoying the start of my weekend the way anyone else like me would; I was playing Team Fortress 2 on my brand new Chromebook, going on a massive tear with a frying pan and a death wish. It was hypnotizing, in a way, listening to the sounds of early tinnitus and gibbus snipers screaming. Of course, since I was in a trance, my phone's unecessarily loud yelp made me jump to the point in which I found my head lodged in the ceiling. After twenty minutes, I freed myself from what was thankfully not my drywall tomb, and checked my phone.
